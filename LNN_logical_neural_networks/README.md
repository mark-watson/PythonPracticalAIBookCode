# Neuro symbolic

LNN: https://github.com/IBM/LNN (tutorials are good, but works in progress)

Math-logic blog, experiments with LNN (pretty good examples): https://github.com/VerdantAI/math-blog/blob/master/nesy/LNN_Scratchpad.ipynb

IBMâ€™s Neuro-Symbolic AI Toolkit: https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/toolkit/ is an index of all IBM neuro symbolic projects and tools

Really good Python LNN docs: https://ibm.github.io/LNN/lnn/LNN.html

## So far, I am just playing with the IBM examples, and modifying them.
