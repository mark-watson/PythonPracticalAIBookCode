# PythonPracticalAIBookCode

Example code for my book "Practical Python Artificial Intelligence Programming" that can be purchased at [https://leanpub.com/pythonai](https://leanpub.com/pythonai) or read for free on on the same web site.

This book was first published in February 2023 and I expect to update it to a second edition by May 2023. When purchasing any of my books on Leanpub [https://leanpub.com/u/markwatson](https://leanpub.com/u/markwatson), updates to new editions are free.

## Random notes

- If you see any comments starting with "# %%" in code examples, that is so Python scripts run as individual cells (like in Jupyter notebooks).
