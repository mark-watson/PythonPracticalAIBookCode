### Knowledge Graph Creator

The Knowledge Graph Creator (kgcreator) is a tool for automating the generation of RDF data for Knowledge Graphs from raw text data read from an input directory path.

The Knowledge Graph Creator creates an output file containing RDF triples suitable for loading into any linked data/semantic web data store.

I published the **kgcreator** command line Python app to PyPy: [https://pypi.org/project/kgcreator/](https://pypi.org/project/kgcreator/). The GitHub repository is [https://github.com/mark-watson/kgcreator](https://github.com/mark-watson/kgcreator).
